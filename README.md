# Builder.io Component Demo

This app demonstrates the **Fusion → Builder Publish workflow**: create custom React components using Fusion (Builder.io's AI assistant), then use them as drag-and-drop blocks in Builder's visual editor.

**Perfect for demos showing:**
- AI-generated custom components (Fusion)
- No-code page building (Builder Publish)
- Developer + marketer collaboration

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

### 1. Deploy to a Public URL (Required)
Builder.io's visual editor requires a **publicly accessible URL** to preview and edit your pages. Localhost won't work for Builder.io integration.

**Recommended hosting platforms** (all have free tiers):
- ✅ **Vercel** - Best for Next.js, one-click deploy
- **Netlify** - Great alternative
- **Railway, Render, Fly.io** - Other options

**Why?** Builder.io needs to:
- Fetch your app's content for preview
- Enable real-time editing in the visual editor
- Publish live pages accessible to end users

### 2. Builder.io API Key
Get your API key from [Builder.io Account Settings](https://builder.io/account/organization)

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

**Option A: One-Click Deploy**

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/kinamod/f2p&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY&envDescription=Builder.io%20API%20Key&envLink=https://builder.io/account/organization)

**Option B: CLI**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
# Follow prompts, then set environment variable in Vercel dashboard
```

**Set Environment Variable:**
1. Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY` = `your_api_key_here`
3. Redeploy to apply changes

### Alternative Platforms

**Netlify:**
```bash
npm i -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY in Netlify dashboard
```

**Railway / Render:**
- Connect your GitHub repo
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY` environment variable
- Deploy automatically

## 📋 Demo Flow

### Step 0: One-Time Setup (5 min)
1. Deploy this app to Vercel (or your preferred platform) using the deploy button above
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY` environment variable in your hosting dashboard
3. Note your deployed URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

### Step 1: Create Components in Fusion
- Use Fusion to generate custom React components
- Components are automatically created in `components/` directory
- Styled with CSS Modules (`styles.module.css`)

### Step 2: Auto-Registration
- Components are registered in `builder-registry.ts`
- They become available in Builder.io's component library

### Step 3: Open in Builder.io Editor
- Go to [Builder.io Content](https://builder.io/content)
- Create new page content
- Set URL path (e.g., `/demo`)
- Builder loads your deployed app's components

### Step 4: Drag & Drop
- Find your custom components in the left panel
- Drag them onto the canvas
- Edit props in the right sidebar
- See live preview

### Step 5: Publish
- Click "Publish" in Builder.io
- Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/demo` (or your URL + path)
- Your page is live with custom components!

**This demo showcases:**
- How developers build custom components once (Fusion)
- How marketers drag-and-drop those components to build pages (Builder Publish)
- The power of AI + no-code publishing

## 💻 Local Development

For development and testing locally (note: Builder.io integration requires deployed app):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the component showcase.

**⚠️ Note:** Builder.io's visual editor won't work with localhost. Deploy to a public URL for full functionality.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## 🎨 Creating New Components

Follow these steps to add components that appear in Builder.io:

1. Create component in `components/YourComponent/YourComponent.tsx`
2. Add styles in `components/YourComponent/styles.module.css`
3. Register in `builder-registry.ts` with `Builder.registerComponent()`
4. Component automatically available in Builder.io editor

See `.builderrules` for detailed component creation guidelines.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Builder.io editor shows 404 or can't load components:**
- Ensure your app is deployed to a public URL (not localhost)
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY` is set in your hosting platform
- Check that you've created content in Builder.io with the correct URL path

**Components not appearing in Builder.io:**
- Confirm components are registered in `builder-registry.ts`
- Check that the file is imported in your page routes
- Redeploy after adding new components

**Environment variable not working:**
- Ensure the variable name is exactly `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY`
- Redeploy after adding/changing environment variables
- Check that the API key is correct in Builder.io account settings
